The challenge provided us with a PDF file. Upon opening it, we could only see half of the picoCTF flag.

After referring to the hint for the challenge, I attempted to convert the PDF file to a JPG using an online converter.

Upon opening the JPG file, to my surprise, the other half of the picoCTF flag was visible.
