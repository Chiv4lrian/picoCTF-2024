First, enter the challenge with the given command: 

ssh -p 54282 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net

Use the password provided by the challenge: 84b12bae

After entering the challenge, use the command: ls to view the server contents.

To see checksums of files in the files folder, run:

cd files
sha256sum *

For example, the file e018b574 matches a checksum. View its hash with:

cat e018b574

The hash is: Salted__muI8Ý¯;ZqE+LG(%Al6q?k$qE

Finally, decrypt the hash:

./decrypt.sh files/e018b574

The flag is: picoCTF{trust_but_verify_e018b574}
